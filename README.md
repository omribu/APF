# Artifical Potential Field Navigation Project

Artifical potential field is a method for robot path planning that usually used to control a robot for avoiiding obstacles in front of the robot. This method consists of an atractive and repulsive potential field. The predetermind goal generates the atrractive potential field, a vector from the robots position to the goal. Whereas, the obstacles generate the repulsive potential field, a vector which is pushed away from the obstacles.
